Still a bit awkward, because ee->jjj(V) has to initialise ee->jjj(B) and tries AMEGIC for that.
AMEGIC initialises that fine, but the libraries have to be compiled before (V) can use them.
So the first run will abort with an error, then you have to compile libraries, then run again, compile the remaining libraries, and then it should work.
