Package PDF, version 1.0

This directory contains all methods for the handling of initial state
radiation and parton distribution functions as well as some PDFs.
Currently, the following PDF packages are supported:
- Structure function of an electron, according to
- MRST99, C++ version
- LHAPDF by Walter Giele, housing a variety of PDFs
- CTEQ6, Fortran stand-alone version.

The LHAPDF package can be found in the subdirectory LHAPDF, all other
files are in Main.

Since this directory contains no executable it should be compiled and
linked to any executable in the framework. To install it the first time
follow the sequence

libtoolize --force
aclocal
automake -a
autoconf
configure
make install

Everything should be ready then. Note that the directory ATOOLS is needed
for this.
