@node Shower Parameters
@section Shower Parameters

The shower setup is covered by the `(shower)' section of
the steering file or the shower data file `Shower.dat',
respectively.


The following parameters are used to steer the shower setup.

@menu
* SHOWER_GENERATOR::      Tag to set Sherpa's shower generator.
@end menu


@node SHOWER_GENERATOR
@subsection SHOWER_GENERATOR

The only shower option available in the default Sherpa set-up is 
@option{CSS}, and this is the default for this tag. See the 
module summaries in @ref{Basic structure}
for more details on this shower.

APACIC++, Sherpa's previous shower module is included in 
@code{<prefix>/AddOns/Apacic++}, but is not linked to Sherpa 
in the default installation.

To see the available shower options, the tag 
@code{SHOW_SHOWER_GENERATORS=1} can be specified on the
command line.
