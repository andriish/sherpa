@node Shower Parameters
@section Shower Parameters

The shower setup is covered by the `(shower)' section of
the steering file or the shower data file `Shower.dat',
respectively.


The following parameters are used to steer the shower setup.

@menu
* SHOWER_GENERATOR::      Tag to set Sherpa's shower generator.

* CS Shower options::     Options for Sherpa's default shower.         
@end menu


@node SHOWER_GENERATOR
@subsection SHOWER_GENERATOR

The only shower option currently available in Sherpa is 
@option{CSS}, and this is the default for this tag. See the 
module summaries in @ref{Basic structure} for details about 
this shower.

Different shower modules are in principle supported and more
choices will be provided by Sherpa in the near future.
To list all available shower modules, the tag 
@code{SHOW_SHOWER_GENERATORS=1} can be specified on the
command line.

@subsection CS Shower options
@cindex CSS_KIN_SCHEME
@cindex CSS_PT2MIN
@cindex CSS_EW_MODE

Sherpa's default shower module is based on @mycite{Schumann2007mg}.
A new ordering parameter for initial state splitters was introduced 
in @mycite{Hoeche2009rj} and a novel recoil strategy for initial state 
splittings was proposed in @mycite{Hoeche2009xc}. 
While the ordering variable is fixed, the recoil strategy for dipoles 
with initial-state emitter and final-state spectator can be changed 
for systematics studies. Setting @option{CSS_KIN_SCHEME=0} (default) 
corresponds to using the recoil scheme proposed in @mycite{Hoeche2009xc}, 
while @option{CSS_KIN_SCHEME=1} enables the original recoil strategy.
Note that the latter is more suitable for parton evolution in deep-inelastic
lepton nucleon scattering, see @ref{HERA_DIS} @mycite{Carli2009cg}. 
The lower cutoff of the shower evolution can be set via @option{CSS_PT2MIN}. 
Note that this value is specified in GeV^2.

By default, only QCD splitting functions are enabled in the shower.
If you also want to allow for photon splittings, you can enable them
by using @option{CSS_EW_MODE=1}. Note, that if you have leptons in your
matrix-element final state, they are by default treated by a soft
photon resummation as explained in @ref{QED Corrections}. To avoid
double counting, this has to be disabled as explained in that section.
