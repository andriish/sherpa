DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       Sherpa is a Monte Carlo event generation framework.
       This manual page contains only the very basic information on the synop-
       sis of Sherpa. The full description is maintained as a TeXinfo  manual.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --ff _f_i_l_e
              Sets the run data file to _f_i_l_e.

       --pp _p_a_t_h
              Sets the run path to _p_a_t_h.

       --ee _e_v_e_n_t_s
              Sets the number of events to _e_v_e_n_t_s.

       --OO _l_e_v_e_l
              Sets the output level _l_e_v_e_l, see info file.

       --bb     Switches to non-batch mode, see info file.

       --vv, ----vveerrssiioonn
              Prints versioning information.

       --hh, ----hheellpp
              Prints a short help message.

              Sets the value of a parameter, see info file.

       TTAAGG::=_V_A_L_U_E
              Sets the value of a tag, see info file.

       This is an example for the first invocation of Sherpa

         SShheerrppaa --pp LLHHCC// --ff RRuunn..ddaatt

       The  program  uses run parameter specifications listed in the base file
       _R_u_n_._d_a_t residing in the directory _L_H_C.
