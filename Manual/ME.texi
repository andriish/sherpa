@node Matrix Elements
@section Matrix Elements

The setup of matrix elements is covered by the `(me)' section of
the steering file or the ME data file `ME.dat', respectively.
There are no mandatory settings to be made.

The following parameters are used to steer the matrix element setup.

@menu
* ME_SIGNAL_GENERATOR::     The matrix element generator(s).
* RESULT_DIRECTORY::        The directory to store integration results.
* EVENT_GENERATION_MODE::   The event generation mode.
* SCALES::                  How to compute the scales. 
* COUPLINGS::               How to evaluate the couplings.

@node ME_SIGNAL_GENERATOR
@subsection ME_SIGNAL_GENERATOR
@cindex ME_SIGNAL_GENERATOR
The list of matrix element generators to be employed during the run.
When setting up hard processes from the @option{(processes)} section of the 
input file (see @ref{Processes}), Sherpa calls these generators in order
to check whether either one is capable of generating the corresponding
matrix element. This parameter can also be set on the command line using
option @option{-m}, see @ref{Command line}.

The built-in generators are

@table @option
@item Internal
Simple matrix element library, implementing a variety of 2->2 processes.
@item Amegic
The AMEGIC++ generator published under @mycite{Krauss2001iv}
@item Comix
The @uref{http://comix.freacafe.de,,Comix} generator published under
@mycite{Gleisberg2008fv}
@end table

It is possible to employ an external matrix element generator within Sherpa.

@node RESULT_DIRECTORY
@subsection RESULT_DIRECTORY
@cindex RESULT_DIRECTORY
This parameter specifies the name of the directory
which is used by Sherpa to store integration results
and phasespace mappings. The default is @samp{Results/}.
It can also be set using the command line parameter @option{-r},
see @ref{Command line}. The directory will not be created automatically
by Sherpa, unless the command line parameter @option{-g} is set.


@node EVENT_GENERATION_MODE
@subsection EVENT_GENERATION_MODE
@cindex EVENT_GENERATION_MODE
This parameter specifies the event generation mode.
The two possible options are @option{Weighted} (shortcut
@option{W}) and @option{Unweighted} (shortcut @option{U}).
It can also be set on the command line
using option @option{-w}, see @ref{Command line}.


@node SCALES
@subsection SCALES
@cindex SCALES
This parameter specifies how to compute the renormalization and
factorization scale and potential additional scales.

Sherpa provides several built-in scale schemes.
The options which are currently available are

@table @option
@item VAR
Scales are specified by additional parameters in a form which is understood
by the internal interpreter, see @ref{Interpreter}. If, for example the invariant 
mass of the lepton pair in Drell-Yan production is the desired scale,
the corresponding setup reads

@verbatim
SCALES VAR[Abs2(p[2]+p[3])]
@end verbatim

Renormalization and factorization scales can be chosen differently.
For example in Drell-Yan + jet production one could choose.

@verbatim
SCALES VAR[Abs2(p[2]+p[3])][MPerp2(p[2]+p[3])]
@end verbatim

In this case the factorization scale must be specified first.

@item QCD
The matrix element is clustered onto a core 2->2 configuration using a
k_T-type algorithm with recombination into on-shell partons.
Scales are defined as the minimum of the largest transverse momentum
during clustering and the lowest invariant mass in the core process.

@item METS
The matrix element is clustered onto a core 2->2 configuration using a
k_T-type algorithm with recombination into on-shell particles, which
are determined according to run-time information from the matrix element
generator.
Scales are defined as the minimum of the largest transverse momentum
during clustering and the lowest invariant mass in the core process.
@end table

It is possible to implement a dedicated scale
scheme within Sherpa. For advice on this topic
please contact the authors, @ref{Authors}.


@node COUPLINGS
@subsection COUPLINGS
@cindex COUPLINGS
This parameter specifies how to evaluate couplings in the hard
process. Within Sherpa, this means the scheme to employ
the renormalization scale for reweighting matrix elements,
which are initially computed with a fixed value 
of the coupling constants. If, for example 
the strong coupling is to be evaluated at the
renormalization scale set by the specified scale setter
(cf. @ref{SCALES}), the corresponding value
is @option{QCD}. The currently available options are

@table @option
@item NO   
No reweighting
@item QCD  
Reweighting of QCD couplings only
@item VAR
Couplings specified by an additional parameter in a form which is understood
by the internal interpreter, see @ref{Interpreter}. The tags @kbd{Alpha_QCD}
and @kbd{Alpha_QED} serve as links to the built-in running coupling implementation.

If for example the process @samp{g g -> h g} in effective theory is computed,
one could think of evaluating two powers of the strong coupling at the Higgs mass scale 
and one power at the transverse momentum squared of the gluon.
Assuming the Higgs mass to be 120 GeV, the corresponding reweighting factor would read

@verbatim
SCALES    VAR[...][PPerp(p[2])]
COUPLINGS VAR[sqr(Alpha_QCD(120))*Alpha_QCD(MU_R2)/pow(Alpha_QCD(sqr(E_CMS)))]
@end verbatim
@end table

It is possible to implement a dedicated coupling evaluation
scheme within Sherpa. For advice on this topic please contact
