The interaction model setup is covered by the @code{(model)} section of
the steering file or the model data file @code{Model.dat}, respectively.

The main switch here is called @code{MODEL} and sets the model that Sherpa uses
throughout the simulation run. The default is @option{SM}, for
the Standard Model. For a complete list of available models, 
run Sherpa with @kbd{SHOW_MODEL_SYNTAX=1} on the command line.
This will display not only the available models, but also the
parameters for those models. 

The chosen model also defines the list of particles and their default
properties. With the following switches it is possible to change 
the properties of all fundamental particles:

@table @code
@item MASS[<id>]
Sets the mass (in GeV) of the particle with PDG id @option{<id>}.
@*
Masses of particles and corresponding anti-particles are always set
simultaneously.
For particles with Yukawa couplings, those are set consistent with the
mass (taking into account the MASSIVE flag) by default, but can be modified
using the @option{YUKAWA[<id>]} parameter.

@item MASSIVE[<id>]
Specifies whether the finite mass of particle with PDG id @option{<id>}
is to be considered in matrix-element calculations or not.

@item WIDTH[<id>]
Sets the width (in GeV) of the particle with PDG id @option{<id>}.

@item ACTIVE[<id>]
Enables/disables the particle with PDG id @option{<id>}.

@item STABLE[<id>]
Sets the particle with PDG id @option{<id>} either stable or unstable according
to the following options:
@table @option
@item 0
Particle and anti-particle are unstable
@item 1
Particle and anti-particle are stable
@item 2
Particle is stable, anti-particle is unstable
@item 3
Particle is unstable, anti-particle is stable
@end table
At present this
affects only the simulation of tau decays, dealt with by the HADRONS++ package.
Decays of other particles have to be specified in the process setup
(see @ref{Processes}) and are not treated automatically.

@end table

Note: To set properties of hadrons, you can use the same switches (except for
@code{MASSIVE}) in the fragmentation section, see @ref{Fragmentation}.
