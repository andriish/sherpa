@section Model Parameters

The interaction model setup is covered by the `(model)' section of
the steering file or the model data file `Model.dat', respectively.

Many of the corresponding parameters are model specific and are therefore
not described here. To obtain a list of all possible options, please run
@kbd{Sherpa SHOW_MODEL_SYNTAX=1} and scan the output of the program.

There are a number of parameters, defining the properties of particles
in the matrix elements.

@menu
* MASS[<id>]::     Set the mass of particle with PDG id <id>.
* MASSIVE[<id>]::  Set the particle with PDG id <id> massive.
* WIDTH[<id>]::    Set the width of particle with PDG id <id>.
* ACTIVE[<id>]::   Set the particle with PDG id <id> active.
* STABLE[<id>]::   Set the particle with PDG id <id> stable.

@node MASS[<id>]
@subsection MASS[<id>]
@cindex MASS[<id>]
Sets the mass (in GeV) of the particle with PDG id @option{<id>}.
@*
Masses of particles and corresponding anti-particles are always set
simultaneously.


@node MASSIVE[<id>]
@subsection MASSIVE[<id>]
@cindex MASSIVE[<id>]
Specifies whether the finite mass of particle with PDG id @option{<id>}
is to be considered in matrix-element calculations or not.


@node WIDTH[<id>]
@subsection WIDTH[<id>]
@cindex WIDTH[<id>]
Sets the width (in GeV) of the particle with PDG id @option{<id>}.


@node ACTIVE[<id>]
@subsection ACTIVE[<id>]
@cindex ACTIVE[<id>]
Enables / disables the particle with PDG id @option{<id>}.


@node STABLE[<id>]
@subsection STABLE[<id>]
@cindex STABLE[<id>]
Sets the particle with PDG id @option{<id>} either stable or unstable. At present this
affects only the simulation of lepton decays, dealt with by the HADRONS++ package.
Decays of other particles have to be specified in the process setup
(see @ref{Processes}) and are not treated automatically.
