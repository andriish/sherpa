@node Integration
@section Integration

The integration setup is covered by the `(integration)' section of
the steering file or the integration data file `Integration.dat',
respectively.

The following parameters are used to steer the integration.

@menu
* ERROR::                The relative integration error
* INTEGRATOR::           The integrator type
* VEGAS::                Whether to enable Vegas
* FINISH_OPTIMIZATION::  Whether to fully optimise the Vegas grid
* PSI_NMAX::             Maximum number of points per process
@end menu


@node ERROR
@subsection ERROR
@cindex ERROR
Specifies the relative integration error target.


@node INTEGRATOR
@subsection INTEGRATOR
@cindex INTEGRATOR
Specifies the integrator. The possible integrator types
depend on the matrix element generator. In general users 
should rely on the default value and otherwise seek the 
help of the authors, see @ref{Authors}.
However, there are a few generator independent choices
which have been designed for specific processes and might 
be more efficient there:
@itemize @bullet
 @item @option{1}: is an integrator for a final state of a weak boson,
decaying into two particles plus two or more jets. When this
integrator is used the keyword @code{VHAAG_RES_KF} specifies
the kf-code of the weak boson, the default is W (@code{24}).
@code{VHAAG_RES_D1} and @code{VHAAG_RES_D2} define the
positions of the Boson decay products within the internal
naming scheme, where @code{2} is the position of the first
outgoing particle. The defaults are @code{VHAAG_RES_D1=2}
and @code{VHAAG_RES_D2=3}, which is the correct choice for
all processes where the decay products are the only not
strongly interacting final state particles.
 @item @option{2}: is an integrator designed for pure QCD final
states. It is based on the HAAG algorithm 
@mycite{vanHameren2002tc}.     
@end itemize

@node VEGAS
@subsection VEGAS
@cindex VEGAS
Specifies whether or not to employ Vegas for adaptive integration.
The two possible values are @option{On} and @option{Off}, the
default being @option{On}.


@node FINISH_OPTIMIZATION
@subsection FINISH_OPTIMIZATION
@cindex FINISH_OPTIMIZATION
Specifies whether the full Vegas optimization is to be carried out.
The two possible options are @option{On} and @option{Off}, the
default being @option{On}.

@node PSI_NMAX
@subsection PSI_NMAX
@cindex PSI_NMAX
The maximum number of points before cuts to be generated during integration.
This parameter acts on a process-by-process basis.
