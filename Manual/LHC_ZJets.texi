This example is for an LHC set-up, with a proton--proton collision at 
centre of mass energy 14TeV. The final state is an electron--positron 
pair and up to 4 partons.

Things to notice:
@itemize @bullet
@item the number of events generated is set in the @code{(run)} section.
If this parameter is not set, no events will be generated, but the integration
of the cross section will still occur.

@item the beam particles are specified in the @code{(beam)} section, using 
PDG codes, see @ref{PDG codes}. The beam energy must also be specified in GeV.

@item the process is specified in the @code{(processes)} section, using PDG codes
again. @option{93} is a particle container for light quarks and gluons, see 
@ref{Particle containers}. The @option{4} in curly brackets after the final state 
@option{93} means that the matrix element will be generated with up to 4 extra partons
in the final state, see @ref{Curly brackets}.

@item the multi-jet merging parameter @ref{CKKW} is set
using an algebraic expression. For more information on
algrebraic expressions recognised by Sherpa, see 
@ref{Interpreter}.

@item the @ref{Integration_Error} is set separately for some of the final state 
multiplicities.

@item there is a selector cut on the invariant mass of the lepton pair. This cut 
sheilds the IR singularity as the invariant mass tends to zero, and
focuses on the area around the Z-peak, from 66Gev to 116GeV.

@item the matrix element signal generators have been chosen to be the Internal
hard coded ones in module EXTRA_XS, and Comix.

@item multiple interactions have been switched off.
