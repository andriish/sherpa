@node Choosing DIPOLE_ALPHA
@subsection Choosing DIPOLE_ALPHA

A variation of the parameter @code{DIPOLE_ALPHA} 
(see @ref{Dipole subtraction}) changes the 
contribution from the real (subtracted) piece (@code{RS}) and 
the integrated subtraction terms (@code{I}), keeping their sum constant.
Varying this parameter provides a nice check of the consistency 
of the subtraction procedure and it allows to optimize the
integration performance of the real correction. This piece
has the most complicated momentum phase space and is often the
most time consuming part of the NLO calculation.
The optimal choice depends on the specific setup and can be 
determined best by trial. 

Hints to find a good value: 
@itemize
@item The smaller @code{DIPOLE_ALPHA} is the less dipole term have to be
calculated, thus the less time the evaluation/phase space point takes.
@item Too small choices lead to large cancelations between the @code{RS}
and the @code{I} parts and thus to large statisical errors.
@item For very simple processes (with only a total of two 
partons in the iniatial and the final state
of the born process) the best choice is typically @code{DIPOLE_ALPHA=1}.
The more complicated a process is the smaller @code{DIPOLE_ALPHA} should be
(e.g. with 5 partons the best choice is typically around 0.01).
@item A good choice is typically such that the cross section from the 
@code{RS} piece is significantly positive but not much larger than 
the born cross section.

@node Integrating complicated Loop-ME
@subsection Integrating complicated Loop-ME

For complicated processes the evaluation of one-loop matrix elements
can be very time consuming. The generation time of a fully optimized 
integration grid can become prohibitively long. Rather than using a 
poorly optimized grid in this case it is more advisable to use a grid
optimized with the born matrix elements, since the distibution in
the phase space is rather similar.

This can be done as follows:
@enumerate
@item Run the born piece with a specified (and existing) 
@ref{RESULT_DIRECTORY} and adding the parameter 
@code{RESULT_OMIT_NLO_SUFFIX=1}.
@item Run the loop piece using the same @code{RESULT_DIRECTORY}
and also with @code{RESULT_OMIT_NLO_SUFFIX=1}.
@item Note: while running the total cross section of the born
piece is displayed. This is not an error, the weighted
event generation will produce the correct (one-loop) cross section.
@end enumerate

Note: this will not work for the @code{RS} piece!
