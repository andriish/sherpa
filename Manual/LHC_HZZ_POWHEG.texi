@section LHC_HZZ_POWHEG

This setup implements a matching of NLO matrix elements with the parton 
shower using the POWHEG method, cf. @mycite{Hoche2010pf}, @mycite{Nason2004rx}, 
@mycite{Frixione2007vw}. Its result, after switching on both the hadronisation 
and underlying event modules, can then be directly compared to experimental 
data.

Things to notice:
@itemize @bullet
@item This is a LHC setup at 7 TeV for a parton shower matched NLO 
simulation, using the POWHEG method.
@item The process setup is very similar to @ref{LHC_HWW_POWHEG}.
@item MCFM is used for the virtual term. For 
more information on how to interface @ref{External one-loop ME}s see the 
linked section.
@item Neither hadronisation nor underlying event corrections are taken into 
account. Both can be switched on by setting the relevant @ref{Parameters} 
accordingly.
