The SM inputs for the electroweak sector can be given in four different 
schemes, that correspond to different choices of which SM physics 
parameters are considered fixed and which are derived from the given 
quantities. The input schemes are selected through the @code{EW_SCHEME} 
parameter, whose default is @option{0}. The following options are provided:
@itemize @bullet
  @item  Case @code{0}:
  
    all EW parameters are explicitly given.
    Here the W, Z and Higgs masses are taken as inputs, and
    the parameters @code{1/ALPHAQED(0)}, @code{SIN2THETAW}, @code{VEV}
    and @code{LAMBDA} have to be specified as well. While 
    @code{1/ALPHAQED(0)} corresponds to the fine structure constant
    at zero momentum transfer, the parameters @code{SIN2THETAW}, 
    @code{VEV}, and @code{LAMBDA} thereby specify the weak mixing angle,
    the Higgs field vacuum expectation value, and the Higgs quartic
    coupling respectively.
  @item  Case @code{1}:
  
    all EW parameters are calculated out of the W, Z and Higgs masses and
    @code{1/ALPHAQED(0)}. 
  @item  Case @code{2}:
  
    all EW parameters are calculated out of @code{1/ALPHAQED(0)}, 
    @code{SIN2THETAW}, @code{VEV} and the Higgs mass.
  @item  Case @code{3}:
  
    this choice corresponds to the G_mu-scheme. The EW parameters are 
    calculated out of the weak gauge boson masses M_W, M_Z, the Higgs
    boson mass M_H and the Fermi constant @code{GF}.

To account for quark mixing the CKM matrix elements have to be assigned. 
For this purpose the Wolfenstein parametrization @mycite{Wolfenstein1983yz} is
employed. The order of expansion in the lambda parameter is defined
through @code{CKMORDER}, with default @option{0} corresponding to a unit matrix.
The parameter convention for higher expansion terms reads:

@itemize @bullet
@item  @code{CKMORDER = 1}, the @code{CABIBBO} parameter has to be set,
it parametrizes lambda and has the default value @option{0.2272}.
@item  @code{CKMORDER = 2}, in addition the value of @code{A} has to
be set, its default is @option{0.818}. 
@item  @code{CKMORDER = 3}, the order lambda^3 expansion, @code{ETA}
and @code{RHO} have to be specified. Their default values are @option{0.349} 
and @option{0.227}, respectively.
@end itemize


The remaining parameter to fully specify the Standard Model 
is the strong coupling constant at the Z-pole, given through
@code{ALPHAS(MZ)}. Its default value is @option{0.118}. For 
the two fine structure constants there is the option to provide
fixed values that can be used in calculations of matrix elements
in case running of the couplings is disabled. The two keywords
are @code{1/ALPHAQED(default)} and @code{ALPHAS(default)}. When using
a running strong coupling, the order of the perturbative expansion 
used can be set through @code{ORDER_ALPHAS}, where the default @option{0}
corresponds to one-loop running and @code{1},@code{2},@code{3} 
to 2,3,4-loops, respectively.
