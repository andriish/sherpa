@subsection Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model

  To input MSSM spectra to Sherpa, files that conform to the
  SUSY-Les-Houches-Accord @mycite{Skands2003cj} are used. The actual
  SLHA file name has to be specified by @code{SLHA_INPUT} and has to
  reside in the current run directory, i.e. @code{PATH}. 
  From this file the full low-scale 
  MSSM spectrum is read, including sparticle masses, mixing angles etc.
  In addition information provided on the total particles widths is read 
  from the input file. Note that the setting of masses and widths through
  the SLHA input is superior to setting through @ref{MASS[<id>]} and 
  @ref{WIDTH[<id>]}.
