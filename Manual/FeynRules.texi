To use an arbitrary model generated by the FeynRules package @mycite{Christensen2008py},@mycite{Christensen2009jx}, 
Sherpa must be installed with python support, using @option{--enable-pyext}, as described in @xref{Installation}.
Once installed, the model is made available to Sherpa by running
@verbatim
  Sherpa-generate-model path/to/model
@end verbatim
This may take a while, as all Lorentz structures of the model are converted to Sherpa's C++ format and compiled.
The model parameters are set by a parameter card, as in the case of MadGraph. The file name of the parameter card
can be specified in Sherpa using option @option{PARAM_CARD}

For more details on the Sherpa interface to FeynRules please consult @mycite{Christensen2009jx},@mycite{Hoeche2014kca}.
