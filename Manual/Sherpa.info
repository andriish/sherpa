1 Introduction
**************

Sherpa is a Monte Carlo event generator for the Simulation of
High-Energy Reactions of PArticles in lepton-lepton, lepton-photon,
photon-photon and hadron-hadron collisions.  This document provides
information, which helps users understand and apply SHERPA for their
physics studies. The various options and parameters specifying the
program are compiled, and their meanings are explained. This document
does not aim at giving a complete description of the physics content of
Sherpa.  To this end, the authors refer the reader to the original
publication, JHEP02(2009)007

3 Input structure
*****************

A Sherpa setup is steered by various parameters, associated with the
different components of event generation.

These have to be specified in a run-card which by default is named
"Run.dat" in the current working directory.  If you want to use a
different setup directory for your Sherpa run, you have to specify it
on the command line as `-p <dir>' or `PATH=<dir>'.  To read parameters
from a run-card with a different name, you may specify `-f <file>' or
`RUNDATA=<file>'.

Sherpa's parameters are grouped according to the different aspects of
event generation, e.g. the beam parameters in the group `(beam)' and
the fragmentation parameters in the group `(fragmentation)'.  In the
run-card this looks like:

  (beam){
    BEAM_ENERGY_1 = 7000.
    ...
  }(beam)

Each of these groups is described in detail in another chapter of this
manual, see *note Parameters::.

If such a section or file does not exist in the setup directory, a
Sherpa-wide fallback mechanism is employed, searching the file in
various locations in the following order (where $SHERPA_DAT_PATH is an
optionally set environment variable):
   * `$SHERPA_DAT_PATH/<PATH>/'

   * `$SHERPA_DAT_PATH/'

   * `$prefix/share/SHERPA-MC/<PATH>/'

   * `$prefix/share/SHERPA-MC/'


All parameters can be overwritten on the command line, i.e.
command-line input has the highest priority.  The syntax is

  <prefix>/bin/Sherpa  KEYWORD1=value1 KEYWORD2=value2 ...

To change, e.g., the default number of events, the corresponding
command line reads

  <prefix>/bin/Sherpa  EVENTS=10000

All over Sherpa, particles are defined by the particle code proposed by
the PDG. These codes and the particle properties will be listed during
each run with `OUTPUT=2' for the elementary particles and `OUTPUT=4'
for the hadrons.  In both cases, antiparticles are characterized by a
minus sign in front of their code, e.g. a mu- has code `13', while a
mu+ has `-13'.

There are a few extra features for an easier handling of the parameter
file(s), namely global tag replacement, see *note Tags::, and algebra
interpretation, see *note Interpreter::.

File: Sherpa.info,  Node: Interpreter,  Next: Tags,  Up: Input structure

3.1 Interpreter
===============

Sherpa has a built-in interpreter for algebraic expressions, like
`cos(5/180*M_PI)'.  This interpreter is employed when reading integer
and floating point numbers from input files, such that certain
parameters can be written in a more convenient fashion.  For example it
is possible to specify the factorisation scale as `sqr(91.188)'.
There are predefined tags to alleviate the handling

`M_PI'
     Ludolph's Number to a precision of 12 digits.

`M_C'
     The speed of light in the vacuum.

`E_CMS'
     The total centre of mass energy of the collision.

The expression syntax is in general C-like, except for the extra
function `sqr', which gives the square of its argument. Operator
precedence is the same as in C.  The interpreter can handle functions
with an arbitrary list of parameters, such as `min' and `max'.
The interpreter can be employed to construct arbitrary variables from
four momenta, like e.g. in the context of a parton level selector, see
*note Selectors::.  The corresponding functions are

`Mass(V)'
     The invariant mass of V in GeV.

`Abs2(V)'
     The invariant mass squared of V in GeV^2.

`PPerp(V)'
     The transverse momentum of V in GeV.

`PPerp2(V)'
     The transverse momentum squared of V in GeV^2.

`MPerp(V)'
     The transverse mass of V in GeV.

`MPerp2(V)'
     The transverse mass squared of V in GeV^2.

`Theta(V)'
     The polar angle of V in radians.

`Eta(V)'
     The pseudorapidity of V.

`Phi(V)'
     The azimuthal angle of V in radians.

`Comp(V,I)'
     The I'th component of the vector V.

`PPerpR(V1,V2)'
     The relative transverse momentum between V1 and V2 in GeV.

`ThetaR(V1,V2)'
     The relative angle between V1 and V2 in radians.

`DEta(V1,V2)'
     The rapidity difference between V1 and V2.

`DPhi(V1,V2)'
     The relative polar angle between V1 and V2 in radians.

3.2 Tags
========

Tag replacement in Sherpa is performed through the data reading
routines, which means that it can be performed for virtually all inputs.
Specifying a tag on the command line using the syntax `<Tag>:=<Value>'
will replace every occurrence of `<Tag>' in all files during read-in.
An example tag definition could read

  <prefix>/bin/Sherpa YCUT:=20

and then be used in the (me) and (selector) sections like

  (me){
    RESULT_DIRECTORY = Result_YCUT/
  }(me)
  (selector){
    JetFinder   sqr(YCUT/E_CMS) 1.
  }(selector)

File: Sherpa.info,  Node: EVENTS,  Next: OUTPUT,  Up: Run Parameters

4.1.1 EVENTS
------------

This parameter specifies the number of events to be generated.
It can alternatively be set on the command line through option `-e',
see *note Command line::.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: OUTPUT,  Next: RANDOM_SEED,  Prev: EVENTS,  Up: Run Parameters

4.1.2 OUTPUT
------------

This parameter specifies the output level (verbosity) of the program.
It can alternatively be set on the command line through option `-O',
see *note Command line::.

The value can be any sum of the following:
   * 0: Error messages (-> always displayed).

   * 1: Event display.

   * 2: Informational messages during the run.

   * 4: Tracking messages (lots of output).

   * 8: Debugging messages (even more output).

E.g. OUTPUT=3 would display information, events and errors.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: RANDOM_SEED,  Next: ANALYSIS,  Prev: OUTPUT,  Up: Run Parameters

4.1.3 RANDOM_SEED
-----------------

SHERPA uses a random-number generator as described in [Florida State
University Report FSU-SCRI-87-50].  The two independent integer-valued
seeds are speciﬁed by the option "RANDOM SEED=A B". The seeds A and B
may range from 0 to 31328 and from 0 to 30081, respectively. If RANDOM
SEED is not speciﬁed at all or only by one integer number, the old
random-number generator (SHERPA 1.0.6 and older) will be used.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: ANALYSIS,  Next: ANALYSIS_OUTPUT,  Prev: RANDOM_SEED,  Up: Run Parameters

4.1.4 ANALYSIS
--------------

Analysis routines can be switched on or oﬀ by setting the ANALYSIS flag.
The default is no analysis, corresponding to option `0'.

The following analysis handlers are currently available
`Internal'
     Sherpa's internal analysis handler.
     To use this option, the package must be configured with option
     `--enable-analysis'.
     An output directory can be speciﬁed using *note ANALYSIS_OUTPUT::.

`Rivet'
     The Rivet package, see Rivet Website.
     To enable it, Rivet and HepMC have to be installed and Sherpa must
     be configured as described in *note Rivet analyses::.

Multiple options can be combined using a comma, e.g.
`ANALYSIS=Internal,Rivet'.

4.1.5 ANALYSIS_OUTPUT
---------------------

Name of the directory for generated histogram files when using the
Internal analysis, see *note ANALYSIS::. This directory will be created
w.r.t. the working directory.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: TIMEOUT,  Next: BATCH_MODE,  Prev: ANALYSIS_OUTPUT,  Up: Run Parameters

4.1.6 TIMEOUT
-------------

A run time limitation can be given in user CPU seconds through TIMEOUT.
This option is of some relevance when running SHERPA on a batch system.
Since in many cases jobs are just terminated, this allows to interrupt
a run, to store all relevant information and to restart it without any
loss. This is particularly interesting when carrying out long
integrations.  Contrary, setting the TIMEOUT variable to -1, which is
the default setting, translates into having no run time limitation at
all.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: BATCH_MODE,  Next: SPIN_CORRELATIONS,  Prev: TIMEOUT,  Up: Run Parameters

4.1.7 BATCH_MODE
----------------

Whether or not to run Sherpa in batch mode. The default is `1', meaning
Sherpa does not attempt to save runtime information when catching a
signal or an exception.  On the contrary, if option `0' is used, Sherpa
will store potential integration information and analysis results, once
the run is terminated abnormally.

_Note that when running the code on a cluster or in a grid environment,
BATCH_MODE should never be different from 1._


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: SPIN_CORRELATIONS,  Next: NUM_ACCURACY,  Prev: BATCH_MODE,  Up: Run Parameters

4.1.8 SPIN_CORRELATIONS
-----------------------

The algorithm used to transfer spin-correlation information from
AMEGIC++ to HADRONS++ is switched off (=0) by default. It can be
switched on via SPIN CORRELATIONS=1. Process libraries have to be
re-created in this case.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: NUM_ACCURACY,  Next: Event output formats,  Prev: SPIN_CORRELATIONS,  Up: Run Parameters

4.1.9 NUM_ACCURACY
------------------

The targeted numerical accuracy can be speciﬁed through NUM ACCURACY,
e.g. for comparing two numbers. This might have to be reduced if gauge
tests fail for numerical reasons.

source code.  If not specified otherwise, sets `SHERPA_LIB_PATH' to
`$SHERPA_CPP_PATH/Process/lib'.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: SHERPA_LIB_PATH,  Prev: SHERPA_CPP_PATH,  Up: Run Parameters

4.1.11 SHERPA_LIB_PATH
----------------------

The path in which Sherpa looks for dynamically bound libraries from
previously created C++ source code, cf. *note SHERPA_CPP_PATH::.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: Event output formats,  Next: SHERPA_CPP_PATH,  Prev: NUM_ACCURACY,  Up: Run Parameters

4.1.12 Event output formats
---------------------------

Sherpa provides the possibility to output events - either to file or to
screen - in its native and two other output formats: The HepEVT common
block structure or the HepMC format.  The authors of Sherpa assume that
the user is sufficiently acquainted with these formats when selecting
them.

There are two ways to specify the event record. First of all the switch
EVENT_MODE (*Note EVENT_MODE::.) results in the corresponding structure
being filled internally (and printed to screen, if the output-level is
set accordingly).

Second, if the events are to be written to file, the keywords listed
below can be used. With these keywords the filename's root can be
specified, i.e. HEPEVT_OUTPUT=filename will create files named
filename.#.hepevt, where the hash mark stands for an increasing number.

To write events directly to gzipped files instead of plain text, the
option -enable-gzip has to be specified during the installation.

* Menu:

* EVENT_MODE::        Format for screen display of events.
* SHERPA_OUTPUT::     Name of file to write event output in Sherpa format.
* HEPMC2_GENEVENT_OUTPUT:: Name of file to write event output in HepMC::IO_GenEvent format.
* FILE_SIZE::         Number of events per file (default: 1000).
* EVT_FILE_PATH::     Directory where the files will be stored.

4.2 Beam Parameters
===================

The setup of the colliding beams is covered by the `(beam)' section of
the steering file or the beam data file `Beam.dat', respectively. The
_mandatory settings_ to be made are

   * The initial beam particles specified through `BEAM_1' and
     `BEAM_2', given by their PDG particle number. For (anti)protons

     `BEAM_ENERGY_1' and `BEAM_ENERGY_2', given in units of GeV.

A List of available Beam spectra is given in section *note Beam
Spectra::.

* Menu:

* Beam Spectra::  List of available beam spectra

The following parameters are used to steer the beam setup.

* Menu:

* BEAM_1::            PDG ID of the first beam particle.
* BEAM_2::            PDG ID of the second beam particle.
* BEAM_ENERGY_1::     Energy of the first beam particle.

File: Sherpa.info,  Node: Beam Spectra,  Next: BEAM_1,  Up: Beam Parameters

4.2.1 Beam Spectra
------------------

Possible values are
`Monochromatic'
     The beam energy is unaltered and the beam particles remain
     unchanged.  That is the default and corresponds to ordinary
     hadron-hadron or lepton-lepton collisions.

`Laser_Backscattering'
     This can be used to describe the backscattering of a laser beam
     off initial leptons. The energy distribution of the emerging
     photon beams is modelled by the CompAZ parametrization, see Acta
     Phys.Polon. B34 (2003) 2741-2758 [hep-ex/0207021].  Note that this
     parametrization is valid only for the proposed TESLA photon
     collider, as various assumptions about the laser parameters and
     the initial lepton beam energy have been made.

`Simple_Compton'
     This corresponds to a simple light backscattering off the initial
     lepton beam and produces initial-state photons with a
     corresponding energy spectrum.

`EPA'
     This enables the equivalent photon approximation for colliding
     protons. The resulting beam particles are photons that follow a
     dipole form factor parametrization, see Phys. Rept. 15 (1974) 181.

`Spectrum_Reader'
     A user defined spectrum is used to describe the energy spectrum of
     the assumed new beam particles. The name of the corresponding
     spectrum file needs to be given through the keywords *note
     SPECTRUM_FILE_1:: and *note SPECTRUM_FILE_2::.

Many of the corresponding parameters are model specific and are
therefore not described here. To obtain a list of all possible options,
please run `Sherpa SHOW_MODEL_SYNTAX=1' and scan the output of the

There are a number of parameters, defining the properties of particles
in the matrix elements.

File: Sherpa.info,  Node: ME_SIGNAL_GENERATOR,  Next: RESULT_DIRECTORY,  Up: Matrix Elements

4.5.1 ME_SIGNAL_GENERATOR
-------------------------

The list of matrix element generators to be employed during the run.
When setting up hard processes from the `(processes)' section of the
input file (see *note Processes::), Sherpa calls these generators in
order to check whether either one is capable of generating the
corresponding matrix element.

The built-in generators are

`Internal'
     Simple matrix element library, implementing a variety of 2->2
     processes.

`Amegic'
     The AMEGIC++ generator published under JHEP 02(2002)044

`Comix'
     The Comix generator published under JHEP 12(2008)039

It is possible to employ an external matrix element generator within
Sherpa.  For advice on this topic please contact the authors, *note

automatically by Sherpa.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: EVENT_GENERATION_MODE,  Next: K_FACTOR_SCHEME,  Prev: RESULT_DIRECTORY,  Up: Matrix Elements

4.5.3 EVENT_GENERATION_MODE
---------------------------

This parameter specifies the event generation mode.  The two possible
modes are `Weighted' and `Unweighted'.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: K_FACTOR_SCHEME,  Next: SCALE_SCHEME,  Prev: EVENT_GENERATION_MODE,  Up: Matrix Elements

4.5.4 K_FACTOR_SCHEME
---------------------

This parameter specifies the K-factor scheme.  Within Sherpa, this
means the scheme to employ the renormalization scale for reweighting
matrix elements, which are initially computed with a fixed value for
the coupling constants. If, for example the strong coupling is to be
evaluated at the renormalization scale set by the specified scale setter
(cf. *note SCALE_SCHEME::), the corresponding value is `QCD'. The
available options are

`NO'
     No reweighting

`QCD'
     reweighting of QCD couplings only

It is possible to implement a dedicated K-factor scheme within Sherpa.
For advice on this topic please contact the authors, *note Authors::.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: SCALE_SCHEME,  Next: FACTORIZATION_SCALE,  Prev: K_FACTOR_SCHEME,  Up: Matrix Elements

4.5.5 SCALE_SCHEME
------------------

This parameter specifies the scale scheme.  Within Sherpa, this means
the scheme to compute the renormalization and factorization scales.

Sherpa provides several built-in scale schemes.  The options which are
currently available are

`VAR'
     Scales are specified by the parameters `RENORMALIZATION_SCALE' and
     `FACTORIZATION_SCALE' in a form which is understood by the
     internal interpreter, see *note Interpreter::. If, for example the
     invariant mass of the lepton pair in Drell-Yan production is the
     desired scale, the corresponding setup reads


     FACTORIZATION_SCALE Abs2(p[2]+p[3])
     RENORMALIZATION_SCALE Abs2(p[2]+p[3])

`QCD'
     The matrix element is clustered onto a core 2->2 configuration
     using a k_T-type algorithm with recombination into on-shell
     partons.  Scales are defined as the minimum of the largest
     transverse momentum during clustering and the lowest invariant
     mass in the core process.

`METS'
     The matrix element is clustered onto a core 2->2 configuration
     using a k_T-type algorithm with recombination into on-shell
     particles, which are determined according to run-time information
     from the matrix element generator. QCD clusterings are preferred
     over electroweak ones.  Scales are defined as the minimum of the
     largest transverse momentum during clustering and the lowest
     invariant mass in the core process.

It is possible to implement a dedicated scale scheme within Sherpa. For
advice on this topic please contact the authors, *note Authors::.

`Selector.dat', respectively.

Sherpa provides the following selectors

* Menu:

* One particle selectors::    one particle selectors
* Two particle selectors::    two particle selectors
* Jet finders::               cuts on QCD partons
* Universal selector::        user-defined cuts


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: One particle selectors,  Next: Two particle selectors,  Up: Selectors

4.7.1 One particle selectors
----------------------------

The selectors listed here implement cuts on the matrix element level,
based on single particle kinematics.  The corresponding  syntax in
`Selector.dat' is

<keyword> <flavour code> <min value> <max value>

`<min value>' and `<max value>' are floating point numbers, which can
also be given in a form that is understood by the internal algebra
interpreter, see *note Interpreter::.  The selectors act on _all_
possible particles with the given flavour. Their respective keywords are

`Energy'
     energy cut

`ET'
     transverse energy cut

`PT'
     transverse momentum cut

`Rapidity'
     rapidity cut

`PseudoRapidity'
     pseudorapidity cut

4.7.2 Two particle selectors
----------------------------

The selectors listed here implement cuts on the matrix element level,
based on two particle kinematics.  The corresponding  syntax in
`Selector.dat' is

<keyword> <flavour1 code> <flavour2 code> <min value> <max value>

`<min value>' and `<max value>' are floating point numbers, which can
also be given in a form that is understood by the internal algebra
interpreter, see *note Interpreter::.  The selectors act on _all_
possible particles with the given flavour. Their respective keywords are

`Mass'
     invariant mass

`Angle'
     angular separation (rad)

`BeamAngle'
     angular separation w.r.t. beam

     (`<flavour2 code>' is 0 or 1, referring to beam 1 or 2)

`DeltaEta'
     pseudorapidity separation

`DeltaPhi'
     azimuthal angle separation (rad)

`DeltaR'
     R separation


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: Jet finders,  Next: Universal selector,  Prev: Two particle selectors,  Up: Selectors

4.7.3 Jet finders
-----------------

There are two different types of jet finders

`JetFinder'
     k_T-algorithm

`ConeFinder'
     cone-algorithm

Their respective syntax is

JetFinder  <ycut>[<ycut decay 1>[<ycut decay 11>...]...]... <D parameter>
ConeFinder <min R>

For `JetFinder', it is possible to give different values of ycut in
individual subprocesses of a production-decay chain.  The square
brackets are then used to denote the decays.  In case only one uniform
set of ycut is to be used, the square brackets are left out.

`<ycut>', `<min R>' and `<D parameter>' are floating point numbers,
which can also be given in a form that is understood by the internal
algebra interpreter, see *note Interpreter::.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: Universal selector,  Prev: Jet finders,  Up: Selectors

4.7.4 Universal selector
------------------------

The universal selector is intended to implement non-stnadard cuts on
the matrix element level. Its syntax is

"<variable>" <kf1>,..,<kfn> <min1>,<max1>;..;<minn>,<maxn> [<order1>,...,<orderm>]

_No additional white spaces are allowed_

The first word has to be double-quoted, and contains the name of the
variable to cut on. The keywords for available predefined <variable>s
can be figured by running Sherpa `SHOW_VARIABLE_SYNTAX=1'.  Or
alternatively, an arbitrary cut variable can be constructed using the
internal interpreter, see *note Interpreter::. This is invoked with the
command `Calc(...)'. In the formula specified there you have to use
place holders for the momenta of the particles: `p[0]' ... `p[n]' hold
the momenta of the respective particles `kf1' ... `kfn'. A list of
available vector functions and operators can be found here *note
Interpreter::.

`<kf1>,..,<kfn>' specify the PDG codes of the particles the variable
has to be calculated from. In case this choice is not unique in the
final state, you have to specify multiple cut ranges
(`<min1>,<max1>;..;<minn>,<maxn>') for all (combinations of) particles
you want to cut on, separated by semicolons.

If no fourth argument is given, the order of cuts is determined
internally, according to Sherpa's process classification scheme.  This
then has to be matched if you want to have different cuts on certain
different particles in the matrix element. To do this, you should put
enough (for the possible number of combinations of your particles)
arbitrary ranges at first and run Sherpa with debugging output for the
universal selector: `Sherpa OUTPUT=2[Variable_Selector::Trigger|15]'.
This will start to produce lots of output during integration, at which
point you can interrupt the run (Ctrl-c). In the
`Variable_Selector::Trigger(): {...}' output you can see, which
particle combinations have been found and which cut range your selector
has held for them (vs. the arbitrary range you specified). From that
you should get an idea, in which order the cuts have to be specified.

If the fourth argument is given, particles are ordered before the cut
is applied. Possible orderings are `PT_UP', `ET_UP', `E_UP' and
`ETA_UP', (increasing p_T, E_T, E, eta). They have to be specified for
each of the particles, separated by commas.

Examples

Two-body transverse mass
     "mT" 11,-12 50,E_CMS

Cut on the pT of only the hardest lepton in the event
     "PT"   90   50.0,E_CMS   [PT_UP]

Using bool operations to restrict eta of the electron to |eta| < 1.1 or 1.5 < |eta| < 2.5
     "Calc(abs(Eta(p[0]))<1.1||(abs(Eta(p[0]))>1.5&&abs(Eta(p[0]))<2.5))"
     11 1,1

     Note the range 1,1 meaning true for bool operations.

Requesting opposite side tag jets in VBF would for example need a setup like this
     "Calc(Eta(p[0])*Eta(p[1]))" 93,93 -100,0 [PT_UP,PT_UP]

Restricting electron+photon mass to be outside of [87.0,97.0]:
     "Calc(Mass(p[0]+p[1])<87.0||Mass(p[0]+p[1])>97.0)" 11,22 1,1

In `Z[lepton lepton] Z[lepton lepton]', cut on mass of lepton-pairs produced from Z's:
     "m"   90,90   80,100;0,E_CMS;0,E_CMS;0,E_CMS;0,E_CMS;80,100;

     Here we use knowledge about the internal ordering to cut only on
     the correct lepton pairs.

5 Tips and Tricks
*****************

* Menu:

* Bash completion:: How to add bash completion for Sherpa parameters
* Rivet analyses:: How to analyse Sherpa events using Rivet
* Versioned installation:: How to install multiple Sherpa versions in the same prefix.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: Bash completion,  Next: Rivet analyses,  Up: Tips and Tricks

5.1 Bash completion
===================

Sherpa will install a file named
`$prefix/share/SHERPA-MC/sherpa-completion' which contains tab
completion functionality for the bash shell. You simply have to source
it in your active shell session by running

  .  $prefix/share/SHERPA-MC/sherpa-completion

and you will be able to tab-complete any parameters on a Sherpa command
line.

To permanently enable this feature in your bash shell, you'll have to
add the source command above to your ~/.bashrc.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: Rivet analyses,  Next: Versioned installation,  Prev: Bash completion,  Up: Tips and Tricks

5.2 Rivet analyses
==================

Sherpa is equipped with an interface to the analysis tool Rivet. To
enable it, Rivet and HepMC have to be installed (e.g. using the Rivet
bootstrap script) and your Sherpa compilation has to be configured with
the following options:

  ./configure --enable-hepmc2=/path/to/hepmc2 --enable-rivet=/path/to/rivet

(Note: Both paths are equal if you used the Rivet bootstrap script.)

To use the interface, specify the switch

  Sherpa ANALYSIS=Rivet

and create an analysis section in "Run.dat" that reads as follows:

  (analysis){
    BEGIN_RIVET {
      -H outputfile
      -a D0_2008_S7662670 CDF_2007_S7057202 D0_2004_S5992206 CDF_2008_S7828950
    } END_RIVET
  }(analysis)

The line starting with "-a" specifies which Rivet analyses to run and
the "-H" switch sets the output file that the histograms are written to.

You can also use "TOOLS/make-html" to create webpages from Rivet's
output files:

  (source /path/to/rivetenv.sh)   # see below
  TOOLS/make-html -o output/ file1.aida [file2.aida, ...]
  firefox output/index.html &

If your Rivet installation is not in a standard location, the bootstrap
script should have created a "rivetenv.sh" which you have to source
before running the "make-html" script.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: Versioned installation,  Prev: Rivet analyses,  Up: Tips and Tricks

5.3 Versioned installation
==========================

If you want to install different Sherpa versions into the same prefix
(e.g. /usr/local), you have to enable versioning of the installed
directories by using the configure option `--enable-versioning'.
Optionally you can even pass an argument to this parameter of what you
want the version tag to look like.

6 Customization
***************

Customizing Sherpa according to your needs.

Sherpa can be easily extended with certain user defined tools.  To this
extent, a corresponding class must be written, equipped with a
corresponding getter function and compiled into an external library
which can be linked to Sherpa at runtime.  Several specific examples
are listed in the following sections.

* Menu:

* External RNG:: How to add an external random number generator.
* External PDF:: How to add an external PDF.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: External RNG,  Next: External PDF,  Up: Customization

6.1 External RNG
================

To use an external Random Number Generator (RNG) in Sherpa, you need to
provide an interface to your RNG in an external dynamic library. This
library is then loaded at runtime and Sherpa replaces the internal RNG
with the one provided.

_In this case Sherpa will not attempt to set, save, read or restore the
RNG_

The corresponding code for the RNG interface is

#include "ATOOLS/Math/Random.H"

using namespace ATOOLS;

class Example_RNG: public External_RNG {
public:
  double Get()
  {
    // your code goes here ...
  }
};// end of class Example_RNG

// this makes Example_RNG loadable in Sherpa
DECLARE_GETTER(Example_RNG_Getter,"Example_RNG",External_RNG,RNG_Key);
External_RNG *Example_RNG_Getter::operator()(const RNG_Key &arg) const
{ return new Example_RNG(); }
// this eventually prints a help message
void Example_RNG_Getter::PrintInfo(std::ostream &str,const size_t width) const
{ str<<"example RNG interface"; }

If the code is compiled into a library called libExampleRNG.so, then
this library is loaded dynamically in Sherpa using the command
`SHERPA_LDADD=ExampleRNG' either on the command line or in `Run.dat'.
If the library is bound at compile time, like e.g.  in cmt, you may
skip this step.

Finally Sherpa is instructed to retrieve the external RNG by specifying
`EXTERNAL_RNG=Example_RNG' on the command line or in `Run.dat'.


File: Sherpa.info,  Node: External PDF,  Prev: External RNG,  Up: Customization

6.2 External PDF
================

To use an external PDF (not included in LHAPDF) in Sherpa, you need to
provide an interface to your PDF in an external dynamic library. This
library is then loaded at runtime and it is possible within Sherpa to
access all PDFs included.

The simplest C++ code to implement your interface looks as follows

#include "PDF/Main/PDF_Base.H"

using namespace PDF;

class Example_PDF: public PDF_Base {
public:
  void Calculate(double x,double Q2)
  {
    // calculate values x f_a(x,Q2) for all a
  }
  double GetXPDF(const ATOOLS::Flavour a)
  {
    // return x f_a(x,Q2)
  }
  virtual PDF_Base *GetCopy()
  {
    return new Example_PDF();
  }
};// end of class Example_PDF

// this makes Example_PDF loadable in Sherpa
DECLARE_PDF_GETTER(Example_PDF_Getter);
PDF_Base *Example_PDF_Getter::operator()(const Parameter_Type &args) const
{ return new Example_PDF(); }
// this eventually prints a help message
void Example_PDF_Getter::PrintInfo
(std::ostream &str,const size_t width) const
{ str<<"example PDF"; }
// this lets Sherpa initialize and unload the library
Example_PDF_Getter *p_get=NULL;
extern "C" void InitPDFLib(const std::string &path)
{ p_get = new Example_PDF_Getter("ExamplePDF"); }
extern "C" void ExitPDFLib() { delete p_get; }

If the code is compiled into a library called libExamplePDFSherpa.so,
then this library is loaded dynamically in Sherpa using
`PDF_LIBRARY=ExamplePDFSherpa' either on the command line, in `Run.dat'
or in `ISR.dat'. If the library is bound at compile time, like e.g. in
cmt, you may skip this step.  It is now possible to list all accessible
PDF sets by specifying `SHOW_PDF_SETS=1' on the command line.

Finally Sherpa is instructed to retrieve the external PDF by specifying
`PDF_SET=ExamplePDF' on the command line, in `Run.dat' or in `ISR.dat'.
