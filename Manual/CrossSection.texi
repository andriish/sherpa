@chapter Cross section

To determine the total cross section, in particular in the context of
running CKKW merging with Sherpa, the final output of the event generation
run should be used, e.g.
@verbatim
+-----------------------------------------------------+
|                                                     |
|  Total XS is 1612.17 pb +- ( 8.48908 pb = 0.52 % )  |
|                                                     |
+-----------------------------------------------------+
@end verbatim
Note that the Monte Carlo error quoted for the total cross section is
determined during event generation. It, therefore, differs
substantially from the error quoted during the integration step.

@b{The exclusive higher order tree-level cross sections determined during 
integration are meaningless by themselves, only the inclusive cross section 
printed at the end of the generation run is to be used.}

@section Sherpa's total cross section

At the end of an event generation run, Sherpa will display its
total cross section for that process. In contrast to plain 
LO cross sections, Sherpa's total cross section is 
composed of the various entries, such that

sigma_tot = sigma_0 * weight_0 + sigma_1 * weight_1 ...

where sigma_i is the cross section for, e.g. Z+i jets (with jet measure 
as specified) and weight_i is the average Sudakov rejection weight on 
this configuration. In principle, both have the same formal accuracy, but 
they will probably always differ by up to 20-30%. Depending on jet definitions, 
process etc., Sherpa's cross section then may be larger or smaller than the 
ordinary LO cross section.

Concerning a comparison with NLO calculations: It is known that for, e.g., 
inclusive Z production the NLO-LO K-factor is about 1.3, give or take. In some setups 
the Sherpa cross section is smaller than the LO one, and therefore further from the
NLO. Therefore, the Sherpa total cross section should @strong{not} be thought of
as being ``improved LO'', which would suggest that it is closer to the NLO 
than the LO cross section. Sherpa total cross sections have LO accuracy.

More technically speaking, Sherpa's merged ME and PS (see @ref{Merging ME and PS}) 
is good for capturing the information from logs (as is the parton 
shower), but typically NLO cross sections are dominated by finite terms, 
as they are often quite inclusive and there are no logs in this case. 
Sherpa's merging algorithm has no way to calculate these finite terms, and 
this is why Sherpa's cross section is not a good approximation to the NLO
cross section.

On the other hand, shapes are typically dominated by logs (especially 
jet pt's etc.). Therefore Sherpa can be expected to perform
reasonably well here.
