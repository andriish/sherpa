@subsection Effective Higgs Couplings
@cindex FINITE_TOP_MASS
@cindex HIGGS_PP_EFF

The EHC describes the effective coupling of gluons to Higgs bosons
via a top-quark loop. This supplement to the Standard Model can be
invoked by specifying @code{MODEL = SM+EHC} in the @code{(model)} section of the
steering file or the model data file @code{Model.dat}, respectively.

The effective coupling of gluons to the Higgs boson g_ggH can be
calculated either for a finite top-quark mass or in the limit of
an infinitely heavy top using the switch @code{FINITE_TOP_MASS=[1,0]}.
The default choice is the latter.

Similarily, the effective coupling of photons to Higgs bosons is
included. Its strength can be set via the @code{HIGGS_PP_EFF} switch.
However, its default is @code{HIGGS_PP_EFF = 0}.
