This setup implements a matching of NLO matrix elements with the parton 
shower using the POWHEG method, cf. @mycite{Hoche2010pf}, @mycite{Nason2004rx}, 
@mycite{Frixione2007vw}. Its result, after switching on both the hadronisation 
and underlying event modules, can then be directly compared to experimental 
data.

Things to notice:
@itemize @bullet
@item This is a Tevatron Run I setup for a parton shower matched NLO 
simulation, using the POWHEG method.
@item The renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to the transverse 
mass of the electron-neutrino pair.
@item The automated dipole subtraction implemented in matrix element generator 
Amegic @mycite{Gleisberg2007md} is used.
@item An internal hard-coded matrix element is used for the virtual term. For 
more information on how to interface @ref{External one-loop ME}s see the 
linked section.
@item The kt-resolution parameter determining the splitting between singular 
and regular real contributions is set to 2.
@item Neither hadronisation nor underlying event corrections are taken into 
account. Both can be switched on by setting the relevant @ref{Parameters} 
accordingly.
