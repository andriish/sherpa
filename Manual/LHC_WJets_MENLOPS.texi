@section LHC_WJets_MENLOPS

This setup implements the MENLOPS method, combining both POWHEG-style 
NLO matrix element parton shower matching and CKKW-style multijet merging, 
cf. @mycite{Hoche2010kg}, @mycite{Hamilton2010wh}. Its result, after switching 
on both the hadronisation and underlying event modules, can then be directly 
compared to experimental data.

Things to notice:
@itemize @bullet
@item This is a LHC setup for inclusive W boson production, using the MENLOPS 
method.
@item The automated dipole subtraction implemented in the matrix element 
generator Amegic @mycite{Gleisberg2007md} is used.
@item An internal hard-coded matrix element is used for the virtual term. For 
more information on how to interface @ref{External one-loop ME}s see the 
linked section.
@item Further, Amegic is invoked for all matrix elements with final state 
multiplicities 2 and 3, while Comix is used for all other.
@item The kt-resolution parameter determining the splitting between singular 
and regular real contributions is set to 8.
@item Neither hadronisation nor underlying event corrections are taken into 
account. Both can be switched on by setting the relevant @ref{Parameters} 
accordingly.
