This example shows a LEP set up, with electrons and positrons colliding 
at a centre of mass energy of 91.25GeV. Two processes have been specified, 
one final state with two or three light quarks and gluons being produced,
and one with a b b-bar pair and possibly an extra light parton. 

Things to notice:
@itemize @bullet
@item the b-quark mass has been enabled for the matrix element calculation
(the default is massless) because it is not negligible for LEP energies
@item the b b-bar process is specified separately because the 
@option{93} particle container contains only partons set massless in the matrix
element calculation, see @ref{Particle containers}. 

@item some model parameters have been set. In the 
@code{(model)} section of the run-card, parameters relating
to the model can be set. In this example, the running of alpha_s 
is set to leading order and the value of alpha_s at the Z-mass is set.
