This example generates QCD events at the Tevatron,
with 2, 3 or 4 final state partons in the matrix
element.

Things to notice:
@itemize @bullet
@item
@code{Order_EW} is set to @option{0}. This
ensures that all final state jets are produced via 
the strong interaction.

@item
an @code{NJetFinder} selector is used to 
set a resolution criterion for the two jets of the core process.
This is necessary because the `CKKW' tag does not apply any cuts to the core
process, but only to the extra-jet matrix elements, see @ref{Merging ME and PS}.
This cut is applied only to the 2->2 process using the @code{@{2@}}
specification, since the higher-order matrix elements should only be cut by
the ME+PS separation criterion.
