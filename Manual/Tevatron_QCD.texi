@section Tevatron_QCD

This example generates QCD events at the Tevatron,
with 2, 3 or 4 final state partons in the matrix
element.

@verbatiminclude ../Examples/Tevatron_QCD/Run.dat

Things to notice:
@itemize @bullet
@item @code{Order_EW} is set to @option{0}. This
ensures that all final state jets are produced via 
the strong interaction.
@item an @code{NJetFinder} selector is used to 
set a resolution criterion for the two jets of the core process.
This is necessary, because the `CKKW' tag does not apply any cut to the core
process, but only to the extra-jet matrix elements.
