The setup of the colliding beams is covered by the @code{(beam)}
section of the steering file or the beam data file @code{Beam.dat},
respectively, see @ref{Input structure}. The @emph{mandatory settings} to be made are

@itemize @bullet
@item The initial beam particles specified through 
@option{BEAM_1} and @option{BEAM_2}, given by their PDG 
particle number. For (anti)protons and (positrons) electrons, 
for example, these are given by (-)2212 or (-)11, respectively. 
The code for photons is 22. 
@item The energies of both incoming beams, defined through 
@option{BEAM_ENERGY_1} and @option{BEAM_ENERGY_2}, 
given in units of GeV.

If desired, you can also specify spectra for beamstrahlung through
@code{BEAM_SPECTRUM_1} and @code{BEAM_SPECTRUM_2}. The possible values are
Possible values are
@table @option
@item Monochromatic
The beam energy is unaltered and the beam particles remain unchanged. 
That is the default and corresponds to ordinary hadron-hadron or 
lepton-lepton collisions.
@item Laser_Backscattering
This can be used to describe the backscattering of a laser beam
off initial leptons. The energy distribution of the emerging 
photon beams is modelled by the CompAZ parametrization, see
@mycite{Zarnecki2002qr}
Note that this parametrization is valid only for the proposed 
TESLA photon collider, as various assumptions about the laser 
parameters and the initial lepton beam energy have been made.
@item Simple_Compton
This corresponds to a simple light backscattering 
off the initial lepton beam and produces initial-state 
photons with a corresponding energy spectrum.
@item EPA
This enables the equivalent photon approximation for
colliding protons. The resulting beam particles are photons that 
follow a dipole form factor parametrization, see @mycite{Budnev1974de}.
The authors would like to thank T. Pierzchala for his help in
implementing and testing the corresponding code.
@item Spectrum_Reader
A user defined spectrum is used to describe the energy spectrum
of the assumed new beam particles. The name of the corresponding
spectrum file needs to be given through the keywords
@code{SPECTRUM_FILE_1} and @code{SPECTRUM_FILE_2}.

The @code{BEAM_SMIN} and @code{BEAM_SMAX} parameters may be used to specify the
minimum/maximum fraction of cms energy
squared after Beamstrahlung. The reference value is the total centre
of mass energy squared of the collision, @emph{not} the 
centre of mass energy after eventual Beamstrahlung.
@*
The parameter can be specified using the internal interpreter, see
@ref{Interpreter}, e.g. as @samp{BEAM_SMIN sqr(20/E_CMS)}.
