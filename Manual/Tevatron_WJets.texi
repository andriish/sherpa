@section Tevatron_WJets

The Tevatron W+jets set-up is very similar to the 
Z+jets example. The only differences are in the 
final state leptons, and the invariant mass cuts on 
the lepton pairs.

@verbatiminclude Examples/Tevatron_WJets/Run.dat
@end smallformat
@end example

Things to notice:
@itemize @bullet
@item the invariant mass cut is necessary to avoid evaluating the PDF outside
its valid range of the factorisation scale @math{Q^2} (which in this process is
typically given by the boson mass).
