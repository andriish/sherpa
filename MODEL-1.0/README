Package MODEL, version 1.0

This directory contains all methods for the handling of models.
Currently, the following spectrum generator/decay evaluation packages are supported:
- Hdecay
- Isajet 7.67

Since this directory contains no executable it should be compiled and
linked to any executable in the framework. To install it the first time
follow the sequence

libtoolize --force
aclocal
automake -a
autoconf
configure
make install

Everything should be ready then. Note that the directory ATOOLS is needed
for this.
