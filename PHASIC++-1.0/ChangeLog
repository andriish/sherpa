 Phasespace Integration
 1.) consistence changes in Phase_Space_Handler
      -> option  Rambo+Rambo to Rambo+Sarge
 2.) Hand multichannel into Phase_Space_Generator 
     to add new channels to the multichannel there.
 3.) Change the method Construct accordingly and let
     it return a boolean instead of the constructed 
     channel.

24/07/02
 Multi_Channel
   - changed to vector
   - added delete in Drop_Channel
   - included sub-channels in Channel_Generator
26/07/02
 ISR and Multi_Channel
   - changed nomenclatur in ISR_Base
   - add Tests in Channels of MultiChannel
29/07/02
 Multi_Channel check ISR channels
   - changed Channel_Generator.C

19/11/02
========
     *	removed "using namespace" from ISR-Headers
     *	changed cout => msg.Error() in Struct.Func.
     *	insert typedef String_List in Channel_Generator.H
 Note: 	Channel_Basics & Channel_Elements are not classes but "namespaces",
	it might be wise to make all member functions static
     *	ISR_Channels moved constructors to c-file (reduces neccessary
	includes in headerfile)
     *	added neccessary "std::"

01.12.02
========
     *  Introduced namespace PHASIC around all Phasespace integration (Main)
     *  Introduced namespace BEAM and added subdirectory Beam (like ISR) for
        beam effects and spectra. This directory has to be extended and fully
	included via suitable channels etc..


07.01.03
========
     *  Commented ExtraXS in again (to merge with Mocaic)

10.01.03
========
     *  Changed the ISR particle handling in the ISR_Handler.
	A new method was added, SetPartonMasses, to update the masses
	and default invecs in the moment the beam-particles are different
	from the process-particles, i.e. different masses (like, for instance,
	in the case of proton-proton collisions).
     *  We have two ISR strategies now for both beams individually.
	However, work has to be spent there to come up with suitable isrchannels.
     *  In the actual integration process (Phase_Space_Handler::Differential),
	the cuts are now updated after the ISR-point has been chosen.
