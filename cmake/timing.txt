The CMakeLists.txt files

Most created with the script automake2cmake.py
The manually edited files contain "#Manually edited" in the first line and will not be overwritten by the script.
The Structure is close to autotools because of the need to deal with Git_Info.C files.

Cross-check

The scripts compileAT and compileCM perform compilation with autotools and cmake and write results to 
compilation databases

The databases can be compared with compare_compil_databases.py

The differences in the set of compiled files, definitions and compile flags are highlighted.
