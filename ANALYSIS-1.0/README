Package ANALYSIS, version 1.0

Since this directory contains no executable it should be compiled and
linked to any executable in the framework. To install it the first time
follow the sequence

libtoolize --force
aclocal
automake -a
autoconf
configure
make install

Everything should be ready then. Note that the directory ATOOLS is needed
for this.
