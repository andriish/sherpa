Package BEAM, version 1.0

This directory contains all methods for the handling of beam spectra
implemented up to now. Currently, two types of spectra are supported:
- Monochromatic beams, i.e. no spectrum at all.
- Laser backscattering spectrum, i.e. the mode for a photon collider 
  option.
It is foreseen that simple beam geometries as well as more spectrum 
options will be implemented. 

Since this directory contains no executable it should be compiled and
linked to any executable in the framework. To install it the first time
follow the sequence

libtoolize --force
aclocal
automake -a
autoconf
configure
make install

Everything should be ready then. Note that the directory ATOOLS is needed
for this.
