========
      * removed "CXX=g++"
	(if needed make "export CXX=g++" before "configure")
  Math
      *	change cout => msg.Tracking() in
	  Random.C Matrix.C Vector.H
	(added Include Dir ../Org)
      *	changed to ANSI C++ Headers
	  complex, cmath,


07.01.03
========
  Phys
      * extended Jet_Finder     
	(added methods like PTij etc. to enable usage of the Jet_Finder in the 
	 Showers, etc.). This leads to a globalization of the Jet_Finder in
	 MOCAIC.
      * extended Running_AlphaS (made Beta0 public + added Nf(t))

10.01.03
========
  Math
      * added a histogram class (should be templated ...)
  Phys
      * added a method UpdateCuts to all Selectors. This method
	is used when integrating with varying c.m. energies (i.e. with ISR).
      * changed the cut handling of the Jet_Finder :
	BuildCuts/UpdateCuts now affects the scut[i][j] of the Cut_Data.
