1. Installation procedures
==========================

On most systems installation is as simple as doing unpacking 
and installation as follows.

   1. Unpacking
      unpack all distribution files one by one
        ATOOLS-2.0.tar.gz  
        EXTRA_XS-1.0.tar.gz  
        PDF-1.0.tar.gz  
        PHASIC++-1.0.tar.gz
        AMEGIC++-2.0.tar.gz  
        APACIC++-2.0.tar.gz  
        MOCAIC++-0.0.tar.gz  
      via 
        "tar -xzf ....tar.gz"

   2. Installation
      in every directory of (in that order)
        ATOOLS-2.0 
	PDF-1.0 
	EXTRA_XS-1.0 
	PHASIC++-1.0 
        AMEGIC++-2.0 
        APACIC++-2.0 
        MOCAIC++-0.0"
      do
        ./configure
        make install "CXXFLAGS=-g"

2. Comments on the directory structure

  a) General
       ATOOLS-2.0   Collection of basic classes used all over the 
 		    Program, e.g. four-momentum, Parameter-Input, etc.
       PDF-1.0      Parton Distribution Functions; in the moment
                    the Proton PDF MRST99, and an Electron Structure 
                    Function are provided therein.
       EXTRA_XS-1.0 Collection of analytic cross sections, used mainly 
		    for comparison reasons.
       PHASIC++-1.0 Phase space integraton module. Provides basic integration
                    routines as Rambo as well as a sufisticated
       AMEGIC++-2.0 Module for the generation and calculation of Matrix 
                    Elements. Further a (multi) process integration and
                    an event generation on Parton level can be used.
       APACIC++-2.0 Parton Shower Module
       MOCAIC++-0.0 preliminary Event Generator frame work, i.e. steering
                    of integration of hard processes and generation of events 
                    including Parton-Shower and Hadronisation
                   

   b) The ATOOLS-2.0 module
   c) The PDF-1.0 module
   d) The EXTRA_XS-1.0 module
   e) The PHASIC++-1.0 module
   f) AMEGIC++-2.0 
   g) The APACIC++-2.0 module
   h) MOCAIC++-0.0
